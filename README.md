# README

Welcome to the Crazy Coffee Concoctions app! This is my fourth project for Flatiron School.
Crazy Coffee Concoctions is a Single Page Application that allows you to write, save, and view your favorite coffee concoctions.
This repository contains the HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend of the project.

## Backend

The Rails API backend of this project is located [here](https://github.com/Sdcrouse/crazy-coffee-concoctions-backend).

## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to get the frontend up and running:
1. Fork and clone this repository onto your own computer.
2. Navigate to the backend repository and follow the installation instructions, up to and including starting the Rails server.
3. With the Rails server running, open the `index.html` file in your browser.

From there, you can do any of the following:
* Click on the `New Concoction` button to generate the `New Concoction` form.
* Fill out the `New Concoction` form to create a new crazy coffee concoction.
* Click on the `Saved Concoctions` drop-down list to see the names of all of your saved concoctions.
